Standard Controls
--------------------
There are 30 controls in Standard controls.Lets c one b one with thier functionality

1)TEXTBOX
------------
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox1" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>

Here  ID="TextBox1"    We can have N number of textBox in web page but all text boxes should have ubique name ,that name is called as ID here,So we should give ID for each controls(TextBox Control)
      runat="server"    This is the server Control Attribute to telling weserver that this s serverControl,or webserver will treat this control as HTML control,So we should compulsory give runat="server" Attribute.

	  Why we Should Use server Controls than HTML Controls??

	  1)HTML C ontrols will not maintain the state of the value,once the data submitted to server,the data get cleared off
	     ASP.NET Server Controls maintains the state of the value even after submitting the data to the server.



		 2)ASP.NET Server Controls can be directly used/accessed in our code but we can not bu used directly in our code(can't go directly to write logic when double click HTML controls)
		   We have to write code like Request.Form["Textboxname"].

		  3)these set of ASP.NET Controls have rich set of properties and methods and events available
		   **************
		   All our server controls are rendered.
		   Rendering???
		   Browser doesn't understand ASP.NET code,its only understand HTML code,So All our ASP.NET code Converted into HTML code,this process called as RENDERING.


		   this is our ASP.Net code

<asp:TextBox ID="UserName" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<asp:Button ID="Submit" runat="server" Text="Submit" OnClick="Submit_Click" />

     this is rendered code (this code only reach our browser)

<input name="UserName" type="text" id="UserName" />
<input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit" id="Submit" />




Every control has its own

1)Property
2)Methods
3)Events

    1)A Property is an attribute of then control which mainly has its impact on the look(Appearence) of the control.so many properties uder each control
